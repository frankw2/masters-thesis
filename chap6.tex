\section{Conclusion}

Sieve is a new access control system
that allows users to selectively expose
their private cloud data to third party
web services. Sieve leverages attribute-based
encryption to translate human-understandable
access policies into cryptographically
enforceable restrictions, and
is the first ABE system to protect against
device loss and supports full revocation
of both data and metadata. Unlike prior
solutions for encrypted storage, Sieve is
compatible with rich, legacy web applications
that require server-side computation.
As a proof of concept, we integrated Sieve
with an open-source health monitoring
service, showing that Sieve is a
practical mechanism for protecting
user data.
